**Goal:**  
• Find the relationship between GDP and life expectancy in six countries  

**Tasks:**  
• Acquire, describe, visualize, and analyze the data  
• Write out insights gained along with the analysis  

**Hypothesis:**  
• There is a strong relationship between GDP and life expectancy in each country  

#### Final conclusion  

**Similarities among all countries:**  
• There is a strong positive relationship between GDP and life expectancy. Life expectancy changes along with GDP  
• Life expectancy has increased over the past 16 years (by 15 years in Zimbabwe and by 2–4 years in the other countries)  
• GDP has significantly increased over the past 16 years, doubling in Germany, the USA, Mexico, and Zimbabwe, and increasing 4–7 times in Chile and China  

A low GDP doesn't necessarily indicate low life expectancy. For example, in Chile, the mean life expectancy ranks among the top two, while its GDP ranks among the bottom two.  

**Differences among all countries:**  
• The average life expectancy in Zimbabwe is only 50 years, while in the other five countries, life expectancy ranges between 74 and 79 years  
• All six countries differ significantly from each other in terms of absolute GDP values. The USA has the highest GDP, while Chile and Zimbabwe have the lowest GDP  

**Dynamics:**  
• All countries except Zimbabwe show consistent growth in GDP, while Zimbabwe experienced a decline in GDP until 2008, followed by explosive growth  
• The same trend applies to life expectancy: all countries except Zimbabwe show consistent growth in life expectancy, while Zimbabwe experienced a decline until 2004, followed by explosive growth  

#### Variables description  
- **Country** - nation (6 nations totally)  
- **Year** - the year for the observation (16 years totally, 2000–2015)  
- **Expectancy** - life expectancy value in years  
- **GDP** - Gross Domestic Product in billions of dollars
